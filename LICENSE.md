# Source-Included License — System Notifier (SNSA 1.0)

Version 1.0 — 05 Sep 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 Anbora Labs. All rights reserved.

This is a source-available license with copyleft obligations and an additional non-compete restriction for the JetBrains Marketplace. It is NOT a free or open source license approved by the OSI.

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software (the “Work”), you agree to these terms.

## 1. Definitions
- “Work” means the software named “System Notifier,” including source code, binaries, assets, and documentation provided by Anbora Labs.
- “You” (or “Your”) means any person or entity that uses, copies, modifies, or distributes the Work.
- “Modify” means to create a derivative work of or adapt the Work, including adding, removing, or changing functionality; integrating substantial parts of the Work into another project; or creating a fork.
- “Publish” means to make the Work or a Modification available to third parties, including without limitation: uploading to public repositories, distributing binaries, offering downloads, or publishing/extending as a plugin on the JetBrains Marketplace or other channels.
- “Modification” means any derivative work of the Work, including forks and changes applied to the Work.
- “Competing Marketplace Offering” means publishing on the JetBrains Marketplace a plugin that is substantially similar in purpose and principal functionality to the Work and is positioned as a substitute, direct alternative, or competitor to the Work.

## 2. Grant of Rights
Subject to the terms and restrictions of this License, Anbora Labs grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (with no right to sublicense except as permitted in Section 3) to:
- Use and run the Work.
- Copy the Work for evaluation, internal use, or backup purposes.
- Modify the Work.
- Publish and distribute the Work and its Modifications, provided you comply with Section 3 (Source Disclosure and Copyleft) and Section 4 (Marketplace Non-Compete).

This License includes a limited patent grant: to the extent necessary to use, modify, and distribute the Work as permitted by this License, Anbora Labs grants a royalty-free license under its necessary patents for that practice. This grant terminates automatically if you initiate any patent litigation alleging that the Work or a Modification infringes any of your patents (see Section 8).

## 3. Source Disclosure and Copyleft
If you Publish the Work or any Modification, ALL of the following conditions must be met:
1) You must make publicly available the complete, human-readable source code of the exact version published (including build scripts and reasonably necessary dependencies to compile it), under this same license (SNSA 1.0) with no additional terms that restrict the rights granted herein.
2) Your binary distributions must include a license notice and a public link to the repository or location where that source code is hosted.
3) Combined works that include substantial parts of the Work must, at a minimum, offer the source code for those parts and for any Modification that intimately interacts with the Work to provide principal functionality derived from it.
4) You may not change the license of the Work or its Modifications to a different license; Modifications must remain under SNSA 1.0.

Note: Strictly internal use without Publication does not trigger the disclosure obligation. Publication to any channel accessible by third parties (including public beta tests, Marketplace listings, or distribution to customers) triggers the disclosure obligation.

## 4. JetBrains Marketplace Non-Compete
Notwithstanding any other rights granted, you may NOT, without prior written permission from Anbora Labs:
- Publish on the JetBrains Marketplace a Competing Marketplace Offering that integrates with, derives from, or is substantially based on the Work or its Modifications; or
- Publish on the JetBrains Marketplace a Competing Marketplace Offering that, even without incorporating code from the Work, substantially replicates the Work’s principal functionality with the purpose of directly competing with the Work in the same category, keywords, or audience targeting.

This restriction is limited to the JetBrains Marketplace. It does not restrict use or publication outside the JetBrains Marketplace, provided you comply with Section 3 and the rest of this License.

## 5. Attribution and Notices
- You must keep intact all copyright, license, attribution, and trademark notices included in the Work and its Modifications.
- When publishing the Work or a Modification, include a visible acknowledgment: “Based on ‘System Notifier’ by Anbora Labs, licensed under SNSA 1.0.”

## 6. Trademarks
This License does not grant any rights to Anbora Labs’ trademarks, trade names, logos, or visual identity. Any use of trademarks requires written permission.

## 7. Third-Party Compatibility
Redistribution that combines the Work with third-party software must respect third-party licenses. Any conflict must be resolved by limiting distribution so that this License and third-party licenses are simultaneously satisfied, or by refraining from distributing where that is not possible.

## 8. Termination
- If you breach this License, your rights terminate automatically. At Anbora Labs’ discretion, rights may be reinstated if you cure the breach within 30 days of notice.
- The patent grant terminates automatically if you initiate or participate in a patent action alleging infringement by the Work or its Modifications.
- Upon termination, you must cease use and distribution of the Work and any Modifications; however, licenses validly granted to third parties prior to termination may continue if those third parties comply with this License.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranty; Limitation of Liability
THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANBORA LABS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
Unless otherwise required by applicable law, this License will be governed by the laws of [specify your preferred jurisdiction], excluding its conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute will be submitted to the courts of that jurisdiction.

## 11. Entire Agreement
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work. Any modification to this License must be made in writing and signed by Anbora Labs.
